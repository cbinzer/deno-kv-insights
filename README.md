# Deno KV Insights

Deno KV Insights is a tool for managing Deno KV database entries.

The tool offers the following functionalities:

- Display of all entries
- Display the details of an entry
- Create a new entry
- Edit an entry
- Delete an entry

At the moment only entries with the value type string can be created and edited. Also not all KV types are supported yet

The project serves at the moment only as an example for the Deno KV Hackathon (06/12/2023 - 06/15/2023).

The project was implemented with Deno Fresh.

## Usage

```
